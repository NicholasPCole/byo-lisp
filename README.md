# byo-lisp

Build Your Own Lisp, a project for @lawrancej's Compiler Design course at
Wentworth Institute of Technology, Summer 2014.

## Goals

I will follow [Build Your Own Lisp](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/), using C
and building a programming language. Chapters 1-15 will be completed, with the
stretch goal of completing individual chapters' "Bonus Marks" sections as well
as Chapter 16, "Bonus Projects".

## Team

@NicholasPCole is working individually on the project.
