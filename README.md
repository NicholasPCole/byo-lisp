# byo-lisp

Build Your Own Lisp, a project for Joey Lawrance's (@lawrancej) [Compiler Design
course](https://github.com/lawrancej/COMP603-2014) at Wentworth Institute of
Technology, Summer 2014.

## Team

Nicholas is working individually on the project.

## Goals

I will follow [Build Your Own Lisp](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/), using C
and building a programming language. Chapters 1-15 will be completed, with the
stretch goal of completing individual chapters' "Bonus Marks" sections as well
as Chapter 16, "Bonus Projects".

Note: Code will be written and tested using the Linux and OS X platforms;
testing on Windows will be relatively infrequent, if at all. When in doubt, use
the `file` command specifying an object file to determine what platform some
source code has been compiled on.

## Progress

Updates will be presented in class each Tuesday in class from July 15 to August
5 inclusive (four weeks). The final day of classes is August 5.

### July 15

* **Who are you working with, if anybody?** I am working individually.
* **What are you working on?** I am following [Build Your Own Lisp](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/).
* **What have you done so far?** I set up this GitHub repository and completed
  Chapters 1 (Introduction) and 2 (Installation). I also created `bonus-marks.md`
  to complete Bonus Marks exercises where possible, and `notes.md` to highlight
  interesting points or things I want to remember from the text.
* **What do you hope to accomplish by next week? How? (Whoâ€™s doing what, if this
  is a team?)** With 15 chapters and approximately four weeks to complete the
  project, I aim to complete an average of three chapters per week.
* **What do you need to move forward?** The first few chapters serve as an
  introduction and overview of C syntax, so I have not encountered any
  difficulties yet.

### July 22

* **What have you done since last week?** I completed [Basics](https://github.com/NicholasPCole/byo-lisp/commit/e5adc18a897401946a6df65cf0745db5bcdf4a81)
  (Chapter 3) and [An Interactive Prompt](https://github.com/NicholasPCole/byo-lisp/commit/4d97ada98b040e56de62ebfb39936b62dad76307)
  (Chapter 4). These chapters reviewed basic C syntax and created a simple
  interactive prompt that echos back what the user types (known as a
  read-evaluate-print loop).

* **What do you hope to accomplish by next week? How?** I hope to complete
  Chapters 5-8 on Languages, Parsing, Evaluation, and Error Handling.

* **What do you need to move forward?** I would like to pick up my pace a bit
  to be closer to my original goal to average three chapters per week. After
  completing those chapters, I will evaluate whether the likelihood of
  finishing an additional chapter or two before next week's progress report.
