# byo-lisp

Build Your Own Lisp, a project for Joey Lawrance's (@lawrancej) Compiler Design
course at Wentworth Institute of Technology, Summer 2014.

## Goals

I will follow [Build Your Own Lisp](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com/), using C
and building a programming language. Chapters 1-15 will be completed, with the
stretch goal of completing individual chapters' "Bonus Marks" sections as well
as Chapter 16, "Bonus Projects".

Note: Code will be written and tested using the Linux and OS X platforms;
testing on Windows will be relatively infrequent, if at all.

## Team

Nicholas is working individually on the project.
