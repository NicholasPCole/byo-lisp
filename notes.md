# Notes

Various snippets, mostly references and notes to myself, as I progress through
the chapters of the book.

## Introduction

* Build Your Own Lisp is partially inspired by tutorials like [Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours).
  Having worked with Scheme in a previous course with [Stephen L. Bloom](http://www.cs.stevens.edu/~bloom/),
  this is a tutorial that I might be interested in after byo-lisp.
